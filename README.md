# seribar

Fiction description for a single world subject to inter-continuum transfers of energy, material, and living organisms.

----

Every culture has a name for "world". Beings that travel, inadvertently, between worlds will, at minimum, choose a name to differentiate between their current world and the world from which they came. **Seribar** is a term of uncertain provenance. It has been used to describe this world for a very long time.

Seribar is part of a cascading scheme of rifts and proximities between worlds (properly speaking, universes) that allow transference of energy, sometimes matter, and -- rarely -- living beings. _Very_ rarely, intelligent beings. Such transfers occur between worlds of differing "magical potential", and are generally in the direction of greater potential to lesser potential. 

The implications are profound. A rift between worlds will allow comparatively powerful beings to pass through with an inherent, or embodied, magical potential. This makes them disproportionately bad-ass; this in turn gives them an unusual capability to establish themselves in a new and characteristically hostile environment.

The strength of this transitional magic diminishes over time (properly speaking exponentially), so eventually the field is leveled. 

Seribar, then, is occupied by many intelligent species, with strange distribution in the planet's history and geography.
